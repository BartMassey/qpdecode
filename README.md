# qpdecode - Quoted-Printable decoder in Haskell
Copyright Â© 2014 Bart Massey

This is a very simple quoted-printable (RFC 2045 sec 6.2)
decoder in Haskell. It reads standard input and writes
standard output. It has currently been benchmarked at about
8MB/sec on my fairly modern box. I have no idea how correct
it is.
